# About WebLogic on Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine

As part of a broad-ranging partnership between Oracle and Microsoft, this project offers support for running Oracle WebLogic Server in Azure Virtual Machine. The partnership includes joint support for a range of Oracle software running on Azure, including Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Linux, and Oracle DB, as well as interoperability between Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Azure. 

This is the main/root git repository for the Azure Resource Management (ARM) templates and other scripts used for the implementation of WebLogic Server on Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine.

## Installation

The [Azure Marketplace WebLogic Server Offering](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?search=WebLogic) offers a simplified UI and installation experience over the full power of the ARM template.

The following are few single/multinode deployment offers that are available in the Azure Marketplace:

- Bootstrap an Oracle Linux VM with pre-installed WebLogic Server (without Administration Server)
- Oracle WebLogic Server with Administration Server
- Oracle WebLogic Server N-Node cluster
- Oracle WebLogic Server N-Node dynamic cluster

In this GitHub project under weblogic-azure-vm you can find the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for each of these Azure Marketplace WebLogic Server Offerings.  These ARM templates can be used to deploy the offering directly from the Azure CLI or Azure Powershell.

The following are the corresponding directories:

- [https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-azure/weblogic-azure-vm/arm-oraclelinux-wls](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-azure/weblogic-azure-vm/arm-oraclelinux-wls)

- [https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-azure/weblogic-azure-vm/arm-oraclelinux-wls-admin](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-azure/weblogic-azure-vm/arm-oraclelinux-wls-admin)

- [https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-azure/weblogic-azure-vm/arm-oraclelinux-wls-cluster](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-azure/weblogic-azure-vm/arm-oraclelinux-wls-cluster)

- [https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-azure/weblogic-azure-vm/arm-oraclelinux-wls-dynamic-cluster](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-azure/weblogic-azure-vm/arm-oraclelinux-wls-dynamic-cluster)

## ARM Template based deployment of Weblogic Offers 

For each WebLogic offer, the sample parameters.json file is located under the "src/main/arm" directory, corresponding to that offer.

**Note**: Oracle recommends that the parameters.json file be deleted or secured after the WebLogic offer deployment is completed, 
so that sensitive information such as user name and password are not inadvertently exposed.

## Documentation

Please refer to the documentation [Oracle WebLogic Server Azure Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/weblogic-server/wlazu/get-started-oracle-weblogic-server-microsoft-azure-iaas.html#GUID-E0B24A45-F496-4509-858E-103F5EBF67A7)
